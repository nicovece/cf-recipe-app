# Recipe Management App

A simple Django web application for managing and storing recipes. This app allows you to create, store, and organize recipes with automatic difficulty calculation based on cooking time and ingredients.

## Features

- **Recipe Management**: Create and store recipes with names, ingredients, and cooking times
- **Automatic Difficulty Calculation**: The app automatically calculates recipe difficulty based on cooking time and number of ingredients
- **Ingredient Lists**: Store ingredients as comma-separated values with automatic list conversion
- **Cooking Time Validation**: Ensures cooking times are reasonable (1 minute to 24 hours)
- **Reference Links**: Add optional reference URLs to recipes
- **Like System**: Built-in like counting system (future feature)
- **Comments**: Support for recipe comments (future feature)

## Difficulty Levels

The app automatically calculates difficulty based on:

- **Easy**: < 10 minutes cooking time, < 4 ingredients
- **Medium**: < 10 minutes cooking time, ≥ 4 ingredients
- **Intermediate**: ≥ 10 minutes cooking time, < 4 ingredients
- **Hard**: ≥ 10 minutes cooking time, ≥ 4 ingredients
